Deep Learning Model Comparison for NIH Chest X-Ray Dataset

This repository contains code and results for a final project that implements and compares multiple deep learning models for multi-label classification of chest pathologies using the NIH Chest X-ray14 dataset available via Box (https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC). The goal is to assess and compare the performance of different architectures on detecting 14 common thoracic diseases from chest radiographs.

Here, we tested three deep learning architectures:
 - CNN (Baseline Model)
 - Pre-trained ResNet50
 - Pre-trained BEiT (BERT Pretraining of Vision Transformer)
